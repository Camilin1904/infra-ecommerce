# 🎯 Infrastructure Status - Per-Environment Resource Groups

## ✅ COMPLETED: Reverted to Per-Environment Resource Groups

You have successfully reverted from the shared resource group approach back to **individual resource groups per environment**. Here's what has been restored:

### 📋 Current Configuration

#### **Resource Group Strategy:**
- **Dev Environment**: `rg-ecommerce-dev` (created by Terraform)
- **Stage Environment**: `rg-ecommerce-stage` (created by Terraform)  
- **Prod Environment**: `rg-ecommerce-prod` (created by Terraform)

#### **Environment Configurations:**
- ✅ **Variables restored**: All environments have `create_resource_group`, `existing_resource_group_name`, `resource_group_location`
- ✅ **Main.tf updated**: Conditional resource group creation logic restored
- ✅ **Outputs fixed**: Resource group outputs use conditional logic
- ✅ **Pipeline cleaned**: Removed shared resource group creation stage
- ✅ **Backend corrected**: Using correct storage account `tfstate1749162202`

#### **Terraform State:**
- ✅ **Dev**: Initialized, validated, and **DEPLOYED** to `rg-ecommerce-dev`
- ✅ **Stage**: Initialized and validated  
- ✅ **Prod**: Initialized and validated

### 🚀 Deployment Options Per Environment

Each environment can now be configured independently:

#### **Option 1: Create New Resource Group (Default)**
```bash
# In terraform.tfvars
create_resource_group = true
resource_group_location = "East US"
```

#### **Option 2: Use Existing Resource Group**
```bash
# In terraform.tfvars
create_resource_group = false
existing_resource_group_name = "your-existing-rg-name"
```

### 📁 Pipeline Flow (Updated)
```
Build_And_Validate
       ↓
Deploy_Dev (auto) → Deploy_Stage (approval) → Deploy_Prod (approval)
```

**Note**: No shared resource group creation stage - each environment manages its own resource group.

### 🔧 Storage Account Configuration
- **Storage Account**: `tfstate1749162202`
- **Container**: `tfstate`
- **Resource Group**: `rg-terraform-state`
- **State Files**:
  - `dev/terraform.tfstate`
  - `stage/terraform.tfstate` 
  - `prod/terraform.tfstate`

## 🎯 Ready for Deployment!

Your infrastructure is now configured for **per-environment resource group deployment** and ready for:

1. **Azure DevOps Pipeline Setup**
2. **Local Development Testing**
3. **Environment-specific Deployments**

### Next Steps:
1. **Test Local Deployment** (Optional):
   ```bash
   cd terraform/envs/dev
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Set up Azure DevOps** (Recommended):
   - Follow: `docs/AZURE-DEVOPS-SETUP.md`
   - Each environment will create its own resource group
   - Clean separation between environments

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Pipeline will deploy dev → stage → prod
   - Each with its own dedicated resource group
